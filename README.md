I and a group of 4 other Morehead-Cain scholars spent 8 weeks in the summer of 2017 researching workforce development in Baltimore. We met with community organizers, government officials, private companies, and most importantly we sat down and talked with the individuals going through the workforce development programs themselves. From talking to these individuals, we learned that before these programs, many didn't think they could overcome their barriers. We share these stories so other Baltimoreans may be motivated to continue to fight their struggles. For those who have not had to juggle child support debt, incarceration, and addiction, we hope it gives insight into an experience very different from their own.
